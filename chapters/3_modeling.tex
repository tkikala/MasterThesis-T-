Like all \acrshort{fsm}s which are applied for \acrshort{mbt}, here also \acrshort{fsm} and \acrshort{efsm} are represented in form of directed graph where vertexes represent possible state of \acrshort{aut} and edges represent actions. Graphwalker requires following naming convention for edges and vertexes. Name of each edge should start with e\_ and name of each vertex except Start should start with v\_.
